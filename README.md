This zip file contains all the raw data relevant to the project involving detection of SUMOylated proteins in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.

The files named human_consolidated_table_with_best_alignment_per_homolog_pair.csv and mouse_consolidated_table_with_best_alignment_per_homolog_pair.csv contain homology annnotations and  lysine mappings for data from human and mouse query proteins respectively.

There are 3 Venn diagrams comparing the list of fly SUMOylated proteins predicted by us and 3 other fly SUMO proteomics experiments, namely the human data,  mouse data and the intersection between human and mouse data - Venn_combined_human_data_after_all_rounds_cgnames.pdf, Venn_combined_mouse_data_after_all_rounds_cgnames.pdf and Venn_comparing_human_and_mouse_data_cgnames.pdf respectively.

For each kind of clustering analysis there are respective folders, such as sequence_motifs, family_specific_motifs and GO_term_analysis.
Each of these folders in turn contain two folders namely for human and mouse data respectively.
All the analysis results have been sorted in descending order of their frequencies / probabilities. Thus, results at the top occur with higher frequencies than results at the bottom.
The folder containing family specific motifs also contains a separate folder named motif_matches_from_remaining_fly_proteome. This folder contains information about motifs matched in the fly proteome missed by PSIBLAST.
